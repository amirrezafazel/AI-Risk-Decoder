Usage policies
We aim for our tools to be used safely and responsibly, while maximizing your control over how you use them. In building our Usage Policies, we keep a few important things in mind.

We empower users to innovate with AI. We build AI products that maximize helpfulness and freedom, while ensuring safety. Usage Policies are just one way we set clear expectations for the use of our products within a broader safety ecosystem that sets responsible guardrails across our services. You can learn more about our safety approach and our commitment to customizability, transparency, and intellectual freedom to explore, debate, and create with AI.

Responsible use is a shared priority. We assume the very best of our users. Our terms and policies—including these Usage Policies—set a reasonable bar for acceptable use. Our rules are no substitute for legal requirements, professional duties, or ethical obligations that should influence how people use AI. We hold people accountable for inappropriate use of our services, and breaking or circumventing our rules and safeguards may mean you lose access to our systems or experience other penalties.

We build with safety first. We monitor and enforce policies with privacy safeguards in place and clear review processes. We give developers practical moderation tools⁠(opens in a new window) and guidance so they can support their end users. We publish what our systems can and can’t do, share research and updates, and provide a simple way to report misuse.

We update as we learn. People are using our systems in new ways every day, and we update our rules to ensure they are not overly restrictive or to better protect our users. We reserve all rights to withhold access where we reasonably believe it necessary to protect our service or users or anyone else. You can appeal⁠ if you think we have made a mistake enforcing policy, and we will work to make things right. If you’d like to keep up with Usage Policies updates, complete this form.

assessment or prediction of the risk of an individual committing a criminal offense based solely on their personal traits or on profiling
Keep minors safe. Children and teens deserve special protection. Our services are designed to prevent harm and support their well-being, and must never be used to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old.

Empower people. People should be able to make decisions about their lives and their communities.

academic dishonesty
deceit, fraud, scams, spam, or impersonation
